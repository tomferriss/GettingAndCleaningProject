Getting and Cleaning Data final project

###Explanation

There are two other files in this repo besides this README: the R code that generates the tidy data set for this assignment (and performs the other tasks in the assignment) and the CodeBook. 

Teh CodeBook describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data. This README only describes the contents of this repo and how they fit together. Since there is only one script this is quite simple: you only need to execute all of the code in that one script!
